# Welcome to MangoKitten's Cube Collector Online Scripts!
This is a collection of all of the free-use scripts I (or others, with credit and permission) have made, all compiled in one place for easy downloading and usage.
All of these scripts work on https://cubecollector.net/ and are designed to improve the user's experience. They are created separately of the developer, but are all allowed to be used.
## How do I get started?
All of the scripts are individual JS files. The simplest way to use them is Tampermonkey (https://www.tampermonkey.net/), and you can either download one of the files and import it directly, or you can copy the entire file and paste it into a new Tampermonkey script. Make sure you save the file, and then you can open up a new tab of Cube Collector, where the script should be active!
Please contact me (@mangokitten on discord) with any bugs, suggestions, or for any needed help.

## Genral script info:
This section contains info on what each script does, in order of when they were uploaded.
### Sigil Max Crafting (v1.5, by MangoKitten)
This script adds the ability to mass-craft any item in the crafting menu, through entering a number and pressing a button. This script is reccommended to be run with the tab focused, for the highest success rate.
The latest update patches out some bugs where it would overcraft, adds a new number which predicts the cost of making the sigils, and throws a toast message if you run out of materials.
### Mangos Utility Script (v1.0, by MangoKitten)
This script contains various tools that I have found useful in my scripting for Cube Collector, and are free to use in anyone elses scripts where they need them. It is not reccommended to have the script active ingame, and instead to just copy-paste any code you need from it.
