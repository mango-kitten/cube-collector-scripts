# Welcome to MangoKitten's Cube Collector Online Scripts!
This is a collection of all of the free-use scripts I (or others, with credit and permission) have made, all compiled in one place for easy downloading and usage.
All of these scripts work on https://cubecollector.net/ and are designed to improve the user's experience. They are created separately of the developer, but are all allowed to be used.
## How do I get started?
All of the scripts are individual JS files. The simplest way to use them is Tampermonkey (https://www.tampermonkey.net/), and you can either download one of the files and import it directly, or you can copy the entire file and paste it into a new Tampermonkey script. Make sure you save the file, and then you can open up a new tab of Cube Collector, where the script should be active!

## Genral script info:
This section contains info on what each script does, in order of when they were uploaded.
